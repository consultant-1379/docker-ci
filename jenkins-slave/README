# Docker Build box

The script will help in creating jenkins slave containers


In order to create slaves we require private ssh key of jenkins master.
The private ssh key of jenkins master is encrypted using ansible vault.
User can create their own password file to decrypt the private ssh key of jenkins master.

## Prerequisite steps to be performed in docker-ci/jenkins-slave/auth/ directory:

1. Create a sshkey file and copy the private ssh key of jenkins master.
2. Create a password file and write any password inside the file for encrypting the key when it runs in container.
3. Provide jenkins url in docker-compose.yml file

## Steps to be followed for creating jenkins slaves

  # Starting 1 slave container
  1. docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
  # --build option is optional and to be only used if user intends to re-create the image or using it for the first time

  # Scaling the slave containers
  2. docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml scale build-start=num_of_slave_to_scal

  # Stopping the slave containers
  3. docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml scale -t 100000 build-start=0
